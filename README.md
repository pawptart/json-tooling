# json-tooling
This repo is a collection of tools that have proven helpful for working with complicated JSON documents within a codebase using [rswag](https://github.com/rswag/rswag). Specific documentation for most of the tools exists within `main.rb` for each tool.

Load the desired payload into a file `payload.rb` or `payload.json` depending on the tool, and then you can run each with `ruby main.rb` from within the tool directory.

Tools were originally hosted on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@pawptart) and can be run there as well.
